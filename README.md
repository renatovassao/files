### magnet2\*
These scripts expect magnet link as first argument, e.g.,

```bash
./magnet2yakuake "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:c12fe1c06bba254a9dc9f519b335aa7c1367a88a"
```

You can setup your browser to run one of them like that.

Most of modern browsers will prompt you to select what program you would like to open when you click a magnet link, but in firefox (my case) is a bit more complicated [(source)](https:////support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1012864)
